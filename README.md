# MATLAB-BIN-PACKING-PROBLEM
Bin / Box Packing problem implemented in MATLAB

Your company manufactures custom gift baskets for various occasions, and you need to pack different items into baskets while minimizing the number of baskets used and the amount of leftover space in each basket. Each item is represented by a tuple (w, h) that indicates its width and height. The available basket sizes are different and are represented by a matrix S of size mx2, where each row represents the width and height of a basket.
Your goal is to pack all the items into the minimum number of baskets while minimizing the leftover space in each basket. You can use any heuristic for the modified bin packing problem, including the first-fit, best-fit, worst-fit, and first-fit-decreasing heuristics.
Write a MATLAB program that takes a list of items and the available basket sizes as input and outputs the minimum number of baskets required to pack all the items using the chosen heuristic. The program should also output the contents of each basket and the leftover space in each basket.
